# Building LLM Applications from Scratch  

🚀 **Build LLM-Powered Applications Like a Pro!**  

Welcome to the Open Sourced version of my course on LLMs.

This course is one of the top-rated technical courses on building **Large Language Model (LLM) applications** from the ground up. So far, I’ve taught this course to **over 1500 professionals**, at MAVEN, Stanford, UCLA and University of Minnesota, helping them gain a deep understanding of **Transformer Architecture**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and **open-source LLM deployment**.  

Unlike most courses that focus on pre-built frameworks like **LangChain**, this course goes beyond by diving into the **building blocks of retrieval systems**, enabling you to **design, build, and deploy your own custom LLM-powered solutions**.
